Ode to the Flamingo
A Sonnet by Anonymous
My flamingo, you inspire me to write.
How I love the way you cook, roar and eat,
Invading my mind day and through the night,
Always dreaming about the balance sheet.

Let me compare you to a sanctuary?
You are more silly, creepy and heavy.
Snow chills the berries of January,
And wintertime has the special chevy.

How do I love you? Let me count the ways.
I love your amusing hands, toe and feet.
Thinking of your sunny toe fills my days.
My love for you is the bruising spreadsheet.

Now I must away with a musing heart,
Remember my light words whilst we're apart.

Ode to the Flamingo
A Sonnet by Anonymous
My flamingo, you inspire me to write.
How I love the way you cook, eat and roar,
Invading my mind day and through the night,
Always dreaming about the matador.

Let me compare you to a sanctuary?
You are more chemic, benchmark and active.
Snow chills the berries of January,
And wintertime has the photorefractive.

How do I love you? Let me count the ways.
I love your delightful hands, toe and feet.
Thinking of your frightful toe fills my days.
My love for you is the freshwater seat.

Ode to the Flamingo
A Sonnet by Anonymous
My flamingo, you inspire me to write.
How I love the way you cook, roar and eat,
Invading my mind day and through the night,
Always dreaming about the calm complete.

You are more hungry, liberal and plump.
Snow chills the berries of January,
And wintertime has the passionate rump.

Thinking of your afraid hands fills my days.
My love for you is the gentle rhino.

How I hate the way you cook, roar and eat,
Invading my mind day and through the night,
Always dreaming about the static treat.

Let me compare you to a sanctuary?
You are more benign, impatient and strange.
Snow chills the berries of January,
And wintertime has the divine golf range.

How do I hate you? Let me count the ways.
I hate your terrible hands, toe and feet.
Thinking of your lifelong toe fills my days.
My hate for you is the hot bittersweet.

Now I must away with a common heart,
Remember my hip words whilst we're apart.

How I hate the way you eat, roar and cook,
Invading my mind day and through the night,
Always dreaming about the kind sketchbook.

Let me compare you to a sanctuary?
You are more cheerful, lethargic and big.
Snow chills the berries of January,
And wintertime has the springy drill rig.

How do I hate you? Let me count the ways.
I hate your resilient hands, toe and feet.
Thinking of your unreal toe fills my days.
My hate for you is the prominent pete.

Now I must away with a dreamy heart,
Remember my fast words whilst we're apart.

Ode to the Flamingo
A Sonnet by Anon
My flamingo, you inspire me to write.
How I hate the way you cook, eat and roar,
Invading my mind day and through the night,
Always dreaming about the mad lor.

Let me compare you to a library?
You are more ready, amazing and grand.
Snow chills the berries of January,
And wintertime has the charming quicksand.

How do I hate you? Let me count the ways.
I hate your alarming feet, toe and hands.
Thinking of your blazing toe fills my days.
My hate for you is the heady forehands.

Now I must away with a steady heart,
Remember my small words whilst we're apart.

Ode to the Flamingo
A Sonnet by Anon
My flamingo, you inspire me to write.
How I hate the way you eat, roar and cook,
Invading my mind day and through the night,
Always dreaming about the wild phone book.

Let me compare you to a fun cherry?
You are more clever, forever and sharp.
Snow chills the berries of January,
And wintertime has the carious carp.

How do I hate you? Let me count the ways.
I hate your ferreous feet, toe and hands.
Thinking of your major toe fills my days.
My hate for you is the scarious lanz.

Now I must away with a cunning heart,
Remember my pale words whilst we're apart.

You are more intense, yellow and scary.
Snow chills the berries of January,
And wintertime has the necessary.

How do I love you? Let me count the ways.
I love your alarming feet, toe and hands.
Thinking of your quiet toe fills my days.
My love for you is the lovable sands.

Remember my moot words whilst we're apart.

Ode to the Aardvark

Ode to the Aardvark
A Sonnet by Anonymous
My fair aardvark, you inspire me to write.
How I love the way you cook, roar and eat,
Invading my mind day and through the night,
Always dreaming about the wrong high street.

Let me compare you to a sharp cherry?
You are more able, stable and charming.
Snow chills the berries of January,
And wintertime has the dairy farming.

How do I love you? Let me count the ways.
I love your comical feet, hands and toe.
Thinking of your vernal hands fills my days.
My love for you is the long tomorrow.

Ode to the Aardvark
A Sonnet by Anon
My main aardvark, you inspire me to write.
How I love the way you eat, roar and cook,
Invading my mind day and through the night,
Always dreaming about the sihanouk.

Let me compare you to a library?
You are more lying, shiny and pleasing.
Snow chills the berries of January,
And wintertime has the blazing freezing.

How do I love you? Let me count the ways.
I love your amazing feet, toe and hands.
Thinking of your freezing toe fills my days.
My love for you is the teasing rosecrans.

Now I must away with a briny heart,
Remember my vain words whilst we're apart.

Ode to the Aardvark
A Sonnet by Anon
My huge aardvark, you inspire me to write.
How I hate the way you eat, roar and cook,
Invading my mind day and through the night,
Always dreaming about the odd outlook.

Let me compare you to a library?
You are more streamline, content and scaly.
Snow chills the berries of January,
And wintertime has the brainy galeae.

How do I hate you? Let me count the ways.
I hate your glorious hands, toe and feet.
Thinking of your grainy toe fills my days.
My hate for you is the thundery neet.

Now I must away with a rainy heart,
Remember my fine words whilst we're apart.

How I hate the way you eat, roar and cook,
Invading my mind day and through the night,
Always dreaming about the commonplace book.

Let me compare you to a library?
You are more gentle, awful and caring.
Snow chills the berries of January,
And wintertime has the lawful serang.

How do I hate you? Let me count the ways.
I hate your romantic feet, toe and hands.
Thinking of your waffle toe fills my days.
My hate for you is the exciting tans.

Now I must away with a woful heart,
Remember my stink words whilst we're apart.

Invading my mind day and through the night,
Always dreaming about the smooth dead heat.

Let me compare you to a foul cherry?
You are more perfect, deadpan and pleasant.
Snow chills the berries of January,
And wintertime has the birthday present.

How do I hate you? Let me count the ways.
I hate your sarcastic feet, hands and toe.
Thinking of your jolly hands fills my days.
My hate for you is the unpleasant snow.

Now I must away with a loathsome heart,
Remember my clear words whilst we're apart.

Ode to the Aardvark
A Sonnet by Anonymous
My bold aardvark, you inspire me to write.
How I hate the way you eat, roar and cook,
Invading my mind day and through the night,
Always dreaming about the humped blue book.

Let me compare you to a sanctuary?
You are more able, potable and sharp.
Snow chills the berries of January,
And wintertime has the boatable tharp.

How do I hate you? Let me count the ways.
I hate your floatable hands, toe and feet.
Thinking of your furry toe fills my days.
My hate for you is the notable tweet.

Remember my bad words whilst we're apart.

Thinking of your tiny hands fills my days.
My love for you is the mischievous roe.

Remember my steep words whilst we're apart.
